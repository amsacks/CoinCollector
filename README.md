# CoinCollector

Collect coin sprites from Super Mario World that randomly spawn on the monitor by controlling the player's movements using the 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' keys on a keyboard. 
Be careful of not colliding with the blue koopa shell, 2 thwomps, and banzai bill that randomly spawn on the monitor, as you lose a life upon collision. You get 3 lives and you must collect enough coins to win.
